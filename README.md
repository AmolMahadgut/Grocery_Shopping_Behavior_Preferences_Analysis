# **Grocery Shopping Behavior & Preferences Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes grocery shopping behaviors across different demographics to uncover actionable insights for businesses. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we identify shopper segmentation, spending patterns, platform preferences, and factors influencing purchasing decisions.  

## **Objectives**  
- Understand the influence of age, income, occupation, and family structure on grocery shopping.  
- Segment shoppers using **K-Means clustering** to identify behavioral groups.  
- Predict shopping preferences using **Decision Tree modeling** to classify nuclear and joint families.  
- Analyze payment preferences, cart abandonment reasons, and digital adoption trends.  
- Provide data-driven strategies for optimizing grocery shopping experiences.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **235 shoppers' profiles**, including:  
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, education, occupation, income range, family structure  
- **Shopping Patterns:** Frequency, preferred stores, primary shopper, shopping companions  
- **Spending Behavior:** Per-visit spend, monthly spend, purchase quantity  
- **Satisfaction Factors:** Pricing, variety, fresh produce, online options  
- **Platform Use & Loyalty:** BigBasket, Zepto, Blinkit, Amazon Fresh, loyalty scores  
- **Cart Abandonment Reasons:** High delivery cost, better deals, payment issues  

## **Methodology**  
- **Data Collection:** Surveys conducted via Google Forms targeting diverse shoppers.  
- **Preprocessing & Transformation:** Data cleaning, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing distributions, correlations, and customer patterns.  
- **Machine Learning Techniques Used:**  
  - **K-Means Clustering** – Segments shopper behavior into distinct groups.  
  - **Decision Tree Classification** – Predicts shopping preferences based on demographics and spending.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing using **Chi-Square & Kruskal-Wallis tests** to validate significance in spending and store choices.  

## **Key Findings**  
### 🛍 **Shopper Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)**  
1. **Budget-Conscious Millennials:** Frequent, low-spending shoppers prioritizing convenience.  
2. **Bulk Buyers:** Less frequent shoppers making planned purchases at trusted stores.  
3. **Affluent Shoppers:** High-spenders favoring branded, premium grocery items.  

### 📊 **Decision Tree Insights**  
- **Prediction Accuracy:** 87% in classifying nuclear vs. joint families.  
- **Strong Predictors:** Monthly spend, spend per visit, shopping time preference, primary shopper role.  
- **Shopping Path Analysis:** Joint families shop in bulk with shared responsibility; nuclear families prefer frequent, smaller trips.  

### 🚀 **Cart Abandonment Analysis**  
- **Top Reasons:** High delivery cost (27.8%) and finding better deals (24.1%) drive abandonment.  
- **Platform Trends:** BigBasket & Blinkit show the highest abandonment rates.  
- **Business Impact:** Improving delivery speed and price competitiveness can reduce abandonment.  

### 🏷 **Payment Behavior**  
- **Most Preferred Mode:** UPI (49.8%), followed by cash (25.5%) and credit/debit cards (23%).  
- **Discount Influence:** Shoppers significantly impacted by discounts when making purchases.  

### 🌍 **Sustainability & Loyalty Trends**  
- **Eco-conscious shoppers exhibit stronger brand loyalty**, preferring sustainable practices.
